\h3{Special blocks}

Often, the content we write falls into some special category like "example", "note", etc.
COWEL supports a large number of \dfn{special block directives},
which wrap their content in a block, with background color, borders, etc.

The input to all special block directives is an HTML context,
they all convert their arguments to HTML attributes,
and they all display as block content.
