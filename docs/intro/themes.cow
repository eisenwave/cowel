\h2{Themes}

COWEL outputs documents that can be viewed in \dfn{light mode} and \dfn{dark mode}.

When the document is opened with support for JavaScript,
there is an button in the top-right that can be used to switch between three modes:
\ul{
  \li{Sync the theme with the OS (default)}
  \li{Light mode (ignoring system preference)}
  \li{Dark mode (ignoring system preference)}
}

Forced light/dark mode works by adding a \tt{light} or \tt{dark}
class to the \cowdoc_html{<html>} element in the DOM.

If you want to customize colors with CSS,
remember to make them respond to theme and OS preference changes.

For reference, you can look at the CSS in the COWEL source code to see how it's done properly.
